\subsection{Validation: silicone oil on an inclined glass plate}

\begin{figure*}

    \caption{%
        A validation case of silicone oil on an inclined plane: $angle=2.5\ \mathrm{\degree}$, $flow\ rate=1.48\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{m^3/s}$, $outflow\ location=(0, 0)$, $surface\ roughness=0\ \mathrm{m}$, and $ambient\ temperature=25\ \mathrm{\degree C}$. %
        The silicone oil have the following properties: $\mu=1096.1\ \mathrm{cP}$ at $25\ \mathrm{\degree C}$ and $\rho=970\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}$ at $15\ \mathrm{\degree C}$. %
        Note the difference in the coordinate scales in sub-figures. %
        Lister did not mention the flow thickness at the flow front. %
        In this simulation results, we use $1\times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{m}$ to determine the flow front.%

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{landspill-maya-gasoline-flat-terrain}
    \caption{%
        Maya crude oil and gasoline above flat terrain near Salt Lake City, Utah. %
        The pipeline rupture point, i.e., the outflow location, is located close to the center of each plot. %
        Maya crude oil has higher viscosity than gasoline. %
        The flow, however, is not affected by the viscosity at the beginning stage, where the inertia dominates the flow due to the high outflow rate from the rupture point. %
        In later stages, the outflow rates becomes much smaller. %
        The evaporation rates start to play a much important role than the viscosity does. %
        Evaporation affects the volume of fluid above ground and then further affects the bottom friction, where the viscosity comes into play in SWEs.%

\subsection{Showcase: Maya crude oil in drainage terrain}

    \caption{%
        A hill area near Salt Lake City, Utah. %
        Extent (left, bottom, right, top) in EPSG3857: $(-12443674, 4976959, -12443264, 4977769)$.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{landspill-maya-hill}
    \caption{%
        Maya crude oil in a hill area near Salt Lake City, Utah. %
        The boxes shown in the figures indicate where the AMR high-resolution grid patches are. %
        In hill areas, flow patterns usually consist of thin but long streams. %
        Resolving the streams with Cartesian grids requires high-resolution grids everywhere in computational domains. %
        And simulations waste much computing power and time because the majority of the grid cells do not have fluid. %
        The use of AMR helps the calculation performance of this type of flows. %
        AMR applies high-resolution grid patches to regions with fluid, while dry regions still use low-resolution grids.%

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{landspill-maya-hydro}
    \caption{%
        Maya crude oil in contact with water bodies. %
        \geoclawlandspill only simulates oil flow above land and does not have hydrographic transport analysis. %
        However, whenever oil flow encounters in-land water bodies, \geoclawlandspill records the location of the oil-water contact and the time history of the oil volume flowing into water at each contact location.  %
        These data can be used as the boundary conditions in other third-party hydrographic transport simulation software.%
